This mod replaces all the music in the game with various Sonic the Hedgehog tracks, mostly from SA1, but a good chunk of SA2 and others as well (and some fun non-sonic surprise tracks!) 
As a heads up, I chose -most- of the songs to fit the mood of the song it's replacing, not specifically trying to tie character themes to other character themes (I.E. Amy's theme not being for Kairi, that shit doesn't fit well.)
Some songs did not change either due to personal preference or because the game literally doesn't have a spot for it for whatever reason. (But it's like 2 or so)

UNCHANGED SONGS:
An Intense Situation (music174.win32.scd) is Unchanged (The main reason I leave this unchanged is because of the Riku-Ansem fight cutscene, as Strain really doesn't fit it.)
Beyond The Door (music191.win32.scd) is Unchanged (I love this song way too much to change it, its one of my favorite Yoko Tracks, also, theres r e a l l y no song to fit it)
